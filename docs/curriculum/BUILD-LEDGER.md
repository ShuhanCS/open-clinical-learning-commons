## Confirmed decisions

- FND-1 and FND-2 are separate straight-through technical foundation courses.
- APP-1 through APP-7 revisit foundations through different domain methods and decisions.
- Applied courses use seven distinct modules. Module 6 contains the week-6 application checkpoint and an embedded half-week machine-learning extension.
- Module 7 is the final clinician-led leadership block.
- Every applied course has cumulative checkpoints at instructional weeks 3 and 6 and on the official last day of the half-term.
- Three-credit courses retain 112.5 total learner hours.
- CAP-0 remains zero credits unless approved program documents change it.
- DA-730 remains separate and moves from a Tableau-centered source course to a concept-first, software-flexible visualization course.
- Public clinical sources, open datasets, and documented synthetic teaching data are core course materials.
- Every module requires exact learner, instructor, data, assessment, rubric, accessibility, and release deliverables.

## Next resume instructions

1. Read the master architecture, DA-730 course specification, Module 01 encoding map, and Module 02 handoff.
2. Write `docs/curriculum/courses/DA-730/modules/03-chart-selection-spec.md` using the module specification contract.
3. Reuse the HCAHPS source where useful and add only a registered source needed to make question-to-display choices meaningfully different.
4. Build a repeatable selection matrix covering comparison, distribution, time, relationship, lookup, multiple-view, and no-display cases.
5. Add the learner lesson, three-tier lab, critique set, assessment, instructor notes, accessibility checks, and release record.
6. Verify the package from a clean module directory before reconciling Module 04.
