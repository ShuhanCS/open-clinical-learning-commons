# Curriculum build ledger

- Current release: 0.14.0
- Last updated: 2026-08-29
- Active phase: DA-730 module specification and build
- Last completed unit: DA-730 Module 03, Chart selection in practice

## Confirmed decisions

- FND-1 and FND-2 are separate straight-through technical foundation courses.
- APP-1 through APP-7 revisit foundations through different domain methods and decisions.
- Applied courses use seven distinct modules. Module 6 contains the week-6 application checkpoint and an embedded half-week machine-learning extension.
- Module 7 is the final clinician-led leadership block.
- Every applied course has cumulative checkpoints at instructional weeks 3 and 6 and on the official last day of the half-term.
- Three-credit courses retain 112.5 total learner hours.
- CAP-0 remains zero credits unless approved program documents change it.
- DA-730 remains separate and moves from a Tableau-centered source course to a concept-first, software-flexible visualization course.
- Public clinical sources, open datasets, and documented synthetic teaching data are core course materials.
- Every module requires exact learner, instructor, data, assessment, rubric, accessibility, and release deliverables.

## Pending confirmation

- Confirm publishable biography and current title directly before release.

## Next resume instructions

1. Read the master architecture, DA-730 course specification, Module 03 handoff, and the existing Module 04 build specification.
2. Audit the Module 04 synthetic emergency-department package against the current 21-section module contract.
3. Resolve the documented provenance gap by recording an approved public calibration source or a clearly bounded synthetic-source decision.
4. Preserve the existing tiered lesson where it satisfies the course contract and add only missing learner, instructor, accessibility, assessment, and release evidence.
5. Run the full Module 04 package and inspect every generated figure.
6. Release Module 04 before starting Module 05.
